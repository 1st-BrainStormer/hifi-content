## Entity Client Script Template

This file contains all entity client script signals. It can be used as a starting point for a new entity client script or as a hifi developer reference guide.

Generic client entity methods and signals that are triggered by mouse or controller interactions.

Client entity scripts are run on a interface instance. Meaning each avatar connected
to a domain have one instance of this script running locally and one client controls
an entity at one time called "ownership over that entity". Best for physics changes.
