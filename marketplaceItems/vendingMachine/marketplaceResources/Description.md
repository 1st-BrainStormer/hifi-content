This vending machine is a blueprint item created by the Experiences team of High Fidelity.  This is an entity you can stage wherever you have edit rights that vends marketplace items.  A user selects what item to buy and clicking on it brings up the marketplace checkout page for that item.  If you check out the code for this item, you'll see we've made it really easy to repackage it with the marketplace items of your choice!  We can't wait to see what you come up with!
