# Draw App

The draw app is a simple app that will be shipped with the client. The app has no UI. When the tablet or toolbar
icon is clicked, a marker appears in the avatar's dominant hand and an opening sound plays. The avatar can then 
draw in desktop or HMD mode with simple white lines that fade after 60 seconds. A sound plays while a line is 
being drawn. The lines can be erased in HMD using the grip button. On closing the app, a closing sound is heard.
