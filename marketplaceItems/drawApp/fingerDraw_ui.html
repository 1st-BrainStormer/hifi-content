        <h1>Thank you for downloading the draw app!</h1>
        <p>This basic app allows you to draw lines with the index finger of your dominant hand in HMD using the trigger. 
            In desktop, simply use your left mouse button to draw 1 meter in front of your camera view. The lines will 
            disappear after 60 seconds unless erased in HMD mode using the grip. You will need to close your tablet to 
            draw. The app is intended to help users who cannot use their microphone or as a quick visual aid during 
            conversation.</p>
            <p>If you would like to remove this app from your tablet and toolbar, open your running scripts (CTRL + j) 
                and close 'fingerDraw_app.js'. If you ever want to reinstall, it can be found for free on the marketplace.</p>
            <p>You will not see this page again unless you redownload the app from the marketplace or your inventory. 
                Simply toggle the app on and off on your tablet or toolbar to enable or disable drawing.</p>
