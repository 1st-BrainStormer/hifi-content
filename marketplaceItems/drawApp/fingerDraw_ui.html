        <h1>Thank you for downloading the draw app!</h1>
        <p>This basic app allows you to draw lines with the index finger of your dominant hand in HMD using the trigger. 
            In desktop, simply use your left mouse button to draw 1 meter in front of your camera view. The lines will 
            disappear after 60 seconds unless erased in HMD mode using the grip. You will need to close your tablet to 
            draw. The app is intended to help users who cannot use their microphone or as a quick visual aid during 
            conversation.</p>
