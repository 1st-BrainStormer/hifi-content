Have you ever wanted to understand what you can do in High Fidelity can to update your avatar? 
Ever want to change your pants material to fit the season? 
Ever needed to express your emotions but didn't know what blendshapes to show?
Ever wanted to setup sick flow physics on your hair or a dangly piece of clothing?

You're in good company. So did I!

Avatar 101 is a learning tool to showcase customizations you and other creators can make to their avatars using High Fidelity. 

*Customizations include:*
1. Avatar materials using material entities
2. Blendshapes applying and manipulating them in High Fidelity
3. Flow using flow avatar joints

The app utilizes “Avi,” a customized Woody avatar, with a jacket submesh, specifically named blendshapes on its face, and flow joints on its leaf hair. We use Avi because he is specifically configured to interact with the app. 

*We highly recommend checking out the Github README and source code to learn more about the customizations!*

Happy learning and happy customizing!

Brought to you by the Experiences team as a blueprint project with the source code and a detailed README about how it was made. Feel free to modify the code to your needs!
