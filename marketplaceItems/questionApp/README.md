# Question App

This basic app allows you to signal that you would like to ask a question during meetings or events.

Simply toggle the app on to put a question mark above your head. Admins in the domain can then see that you are waiting. The question mark will change color over time to show how long you've been waiting.

When an admin is ready for you to ask your question, they will remove your question mark and you will hear a sound. Your app will also toggle off at this time.

## Known Issue
When changing avatars, you will lose your question mark entity. This is handled by closing the app, but the user will lose the status of their question.
