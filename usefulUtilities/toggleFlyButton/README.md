# toggleFlyButton
The `toggleFlyButton.js` script can be attached to any entity. That entity will then become a button that, when clicked, will toggle the clicker's Flying preferences for BOTH Desktop and VR mode.

A text overlay will appear near the entity that will display the user's current Flying preference.
