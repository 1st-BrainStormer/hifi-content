# Loud App

The Seek Loud App helps a domain owner to manage disruptive avatars in their domain. They can solo one avatar to listen to, mute, and ban that user. The default search radius is 10m.

Additional options include: 
- Click on avatar name to highlight their overlay and face that avatar
- Goto button teleports you behind the avatar
- Enable "search for all avatars in domain" will populate the list with the loudest in domain

Happy loud sniping!
